# ⚠️ SECURITY WARNING ⚠️
# The NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables below will be exposed to the browser.
# This is normal for Supabase client-side apps when using Row Level Security (RLS).
# Never put sensitive server-side credentials in NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables.

# Security Notes:
# 1. NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables are exposed to browsers - this is expected
# 2. Supabase security relies on Row Level Security (RLS) policies, not hidden URLs
# 3. Never commit real credentials to version control
# 4. Use different credentials for development vs production
# 5. Regularly rotate your service role key
